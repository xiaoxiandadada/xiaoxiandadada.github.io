# GWAS Note-Taker

## Welcome to Genome CopyCat! 🧬✏️

I'm just a slow-learning student, armed with curiosity and a notebook, copying down every bit of genomic wisdom I can find. Here, you'll find all my scribbles, doodles, and discoveries about genome-wide association studies (GWAS). From decoding SNPs to navigating complex genetic data, I’m here to make it all a little more fun (and maybe a bit easier to understand). 🧠💡
